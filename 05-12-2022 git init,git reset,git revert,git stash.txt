Comminicating with github repo :-

1.created one repo :- 

2.git clone <url> :- we are copying the remote repo to local 

3.will create one file then we will add that file to staging area, .git repo by executing the command 
called 
git commit -m "msg"

4.git push origin <branch-name>

sceanrio :-
----------------
already i have written a source code in my local system 

now i want to add the that source code into github repo... 

Directory called 

facebook source code :- 

I will convert the directory  into git repo 

1.we need to enter into the directory 
Commuincating with github by using git init (adding the local files to github):
------------------------------------------------
step 1 :- we need to enter into the directory where exactly out source code preset

setp 2 :- we need execute a command called 

syntax :- git init :- convert execisting directory into git repo.

          or 

         git init <repo-name> :- to create a new repo in local

step 3 :- we need to connect the local git repo to remote (just we are mapping a local repo to remote repo)

synatx :- git remote add <name-url> <url of github repo>

step 4 :- to check the  mapping we need execute a command called

synatx :- git remote -v 

step 5 :- git status :- to check whether files are there or not (files are added or not)

step 6 :- To add all the files into staging area 
 
           git add . 


step 7 :- git commit -m "msg"

*) Head is indicating a recent commit 




*) git reset :- 

it is used to undo the task 

1.we can remove the files from staging area

synatx :- git reset <file-name>

sceario :- After adding all the files into staging area i dont want to add one file to staging area

y because the work is not completed ..
==================================================

2. we can remove the commits 

sceario :- we are working any application but some part of time i thought
           i need to add some more features into the commit in that time i want to remove the commit 

git reset head~1 :- it will remove the file from commit and staggin area as well

1.git reset --soft head~1  :- just it will remove the commit and sends the file back to staging area 

2.git reset --hard head~2  :- it will delete the file permantely from the git (distructive command) 

====================================================================================================

drawback :-

we are having a drawback in git reset 

1001

In git reset we need to remove the number of commits , it will not support to delete the specific commit
